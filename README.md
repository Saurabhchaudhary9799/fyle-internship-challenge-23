# Fyle Frontend Challenge

## Who is this for?

This challenge is meant for candidates who wish to intern at Fyle and work with our engineering team. The candidate should be able to commit to at least 6 months of dedicated time for internship.

## Why work at Fyle?

Fyle is a fast-growing Expense Management SaaS product. We are ~40 strong engineering team at the moment. 

We are an extremely transparent organization. Check out our [careers page](https://careers.fylehq.com) that will give you a glimpse of what it is like to work at Fyle. Also, check out our Glassdoor reviews [here](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Fyle-Reviews-E1723235.htm). You can read stories from our teammates [here](https://stories.fylehq.com).

## Challenge outline

This challenge involves implementing application using github api. 

The services that you need to use are already implemented - check out ApiService.

__Note__ - This challenge is in angular. We work on angular frameworks & after you join we expect the same from you. Hence it is required to complete this assignement in angular itself.

## What happens next?

You will hear back within 48 hours from us via email.

## Installation

1. Fork this repository to your github account.
2. Clone the forked repository and proceed with steps mentioned below.

### Install requirements
* Install angular cli [Ref](https://angular.io/cli)
* `npm install` in this repository 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Angular.js Unit testing 

This repository contains unit tests for an Angular.js component and service, ensuring code reliability and maintainability. 

the testing is done by Jasmine and Karma.

## Jasmine 

`Jasmine` is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for testing JavaScript code. It provides a clean syntax for writing tests and comes with a rich set of matchers for assertions. Jasmine is often used in conjunction with AngularJS for writing unit tests.

## Karma 

`Karma` is a test runner developed by the AngularJS team. It allows you to execute JavaScript code in multiple real browsers. Karma is highly configurable and integrates seamlessly with testing frameworks like Jasmine and Mocha.

## Writing Unit Tests for Component and Service
 Component Unit Test 
1. Create Test File: In your project's test directory (often named spec or tests), create a new file, let's say component.spec.js.

2. Write Test Cases: Write test cases for your component using Angular's testing utilities like inject and angular.mock.inject. Ensure you cover various scenarios, 
   including input/output testing, DOM manipulation testing, and event testing.

3. Mock Dependencies: If your component has dependencies, mock them using Angular's dependency injection mechanism.

4. Check Code Coverage: Aim for 100% code coverage by ensuring that each line of your component's code is executed by at least one test case.

Service Unit Test

1. Create Test File: Similar to the component, create a test file for your service, e.g., service.spec.js.

2. Write Test Cases: Write test cases to cover all methods and functionalities provided by your service. Mock any external dependencies or API calls.

3. Ensure Coverage: Aim for full code coverage by testing all branches and edge cases in your service.

### Installation Instructions
* Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
* Install Angular.js and its testing dependencies if not already installed.
* Install any testing frameworks or libraries you're using (e.g., Jasmine, Karma).

### Running tests
  
* Provide commands to run tests for both components and services.

* The command is `ng test` for unit testing in `Angular.js`

### Viewing code coverage
  
* Explain how to view code coverage reports generated by your test runner.

* `npm run test -- --code-coverage`
### Interpreting Results
* Explain how to interpret the test results and code coverage reports.
* Highlight any areas where coverage is lacking or where tests are failing.

### Troubleshooting
* Provide common troubleshooting steps if users encounter issues running tests.
* Include links to relevant documentation or community resources for further assistance.
